# Programming Interviews Exposed

## Part 1 — Data Structures That Decide Your Result

I’m rereading _Programming Interviews Exposed (3rd Edition)_ — and it’s a strong reminder that interviews are rarely about “clever tricks”.

They’re about:

- Fundamentals
- Clear thinking
- How you explain your logic under pressure

This is Part 1 of a short series where I’m sharing what actually matters in Data Structures — without overcomplicating it.

---

# 1️⃣ Arrays & Strings

_Simple… until they’re not_

Most interview problems secretly revolve around:

- Two pointers
- Sliding window
- In-place updates

If you truly master strings and arrays, interviews start to feel lighter.

Key reminders:

- O(1) access time
- Off-by-one errors are common traps
- Think about boundaries first

---

# 2️⃣ Linked Lists

_Where pointers expose weak thinking_

Classic interview traps:

- Reverse a list
- Detect a cycle
- Remove k-th node from end

It’s never about syntax.  
It’s about pointer rewiring safely and intentionally.

Important mindset shifts:

- No indexing
- Only references
- Singly vs Doubly linked lists matter

---

# 3️⃣ Stacks & Queues

_Hidden everywhere_

Many problems don’t explicitly say “use a stack” — they expect you to recognize the pattern.

Stack → LIFO  
Used in:

- Recursion
- Undo operations
- Expression parsing

Queue → FIFO  
Used in:

- BFS
- Scheduling
- Streams
- Task processing

---

# 4️⃣ Trees

_Where recursion finally makes sense_

Interview favorites include:

- Height & depth
- Tree traversal
- Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)

If trees scare you, recursion is usually the real issue.

Mindset matters:

- Binary Tree ≠ Binary Search Tree
- DFS vs BFS is a strategic choice

---

# 5️⃣ Hash Tables

_The ultimate shortcut_

Used for:

- Frequency counting
- Deduplication
- Caching
- Turning nested loops into clean logic

Average lookup: O(1)

When stuck in an interview, ask yourself:

> “Can a hash map simplify this?”

---

# Interview Truth

Data structures don’t fail you — preparation does.

Interviews test:

- Thinking patterns
- Communication
- Pattern recognition

Patterns repeat more than problems.

Explain your logic out loud.

That matters more than memorizing solutions.
